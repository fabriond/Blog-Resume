I've worked on many personal projects, I use them as learning experiences for the languages and frameworks I'm trying to learn. In this post I'll detail a bit about some of those projects.

[**Gossiper**](https://gossiper-frontend.herokuapp.com/#/) is one of my latest projects, in which I learned to use NodeJS for the [**backend**](https://github.com/fabriond/Gossiper-Server) and basic VueJS for the [**frontend**](https://github.com/fabriond/Gossiper). In it, people can check for info and comment on Brazilian public expenses accessible via the [**Portal da TransparÃªncia (Transparency Portal)**](http://www.transparencia.gov.br/swagger-ui.html) public API.

[**Raid List**](https://github.com/fabriond/Raid-List) was a project I made with a friend, in developing it we both learned Flutter and used Firebase as a backend. Its original purpose was to create raids groups in Pokemon Go where people could sign into a group and signalize that they've arrived at the raid's location. We've halted development for a bit, due to overload from classes, but we'll return to it soon and make it more generic than just Pokemon Go groups.

In [**AI Pacman**](https://github.com/fabriond/Pacman-IA2) we used the Genetic Algorithm to make the ghosts in Pacman more interesting. I also made this project with a friend, in this project we re-used some of his code for a Pacman game and added some AIs to it, one that makes the ghosts take better decisions on where to go, seeing as decisions were randomized before, and another AI to make the ghosts create shadows of themselves, which disappear in a short time, in one of the directions they chose not to go.

[**Gortic**](https://github.com/fabriond/Gortic) was quite a fun project, it was made in Java using the Sockets library to make a terminal-based multiplayer game of charades. We didn't add many words to it, as it was outside of our scope, but the ones we did add were countries, and the clues were their continents. The game is in english, although the words and clues are in portuguese.
