<p>I'm a young Software Engineer, always enthusiastic about learning new 
languages, algorithms and techniques. Mainly a web developer, I started 
with backend development, but am striving to become a full stack developer.
I've also done some Mobile development, but not much. I'm currently interested 
in learning Data Science and UI/UX design. </p>
